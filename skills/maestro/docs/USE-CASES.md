## Solo Developer Scenarios

### Use Case 1: The Multi-Project Freelancer

**Scenario:** Sarah is a freelance developer juggling 3 client projects simultaneously.

**Setup:**
- **MacBook Pro** (Local Peer)
  - `clients-acme-frontend` - React app for Acme Corp
  - `clients-acme-backend` - API development
  - `clients-beta-mobile` - Flutter app for Beta Inc
  - `clients-gamma-devops` - Infrastructure for Gamma LLC

**Benefits:**
- ✅ All projects visible in one dashboard
- ✅ Quickly switch context between clients
- ✅ Hierarchical organization keeps projects separate
- ✅ Agent notes document decisions for each project
- ✅ Easy to show client progress (share screen of specific agent)

**Why AI Maestro:**
Without AI Maestro, Sarah would need to:
- Remember tmux session names across projects
- `tmux ls` and `tmux attach` repeatedly
- Keep mental map of which agents belong to which client
- Switch between terminal windows constantly

### Use Case 2: The Heavy Workload Developer

**Scenario:** Mike runs resource-intensive AI coding agents that slow down his laptop.

**Setup:**
- **MacBook Air M2** (Peer - 8GB RAM)
  - `personal-blog` - Lightweight documentation agent
  - `learning-tutorials` - Study companion

- **Mac Mini M2 Pro** (Peer - 32GB RAM)
  - `work-monorepo` - Large codebase analysis (high RAM usage)
  - `work-build-agent` - Docker builds (CPU intensive)
  - `work-ml-preprocessing` - Data processing (memory intensive)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Laptop stays responsive for browsing/email/Slack
- ✅ Heavy workloads run on powerful desktop
- ✅ Can close laptop and continue work from iPad (accessing dashboard)
- ✅ Mac Mini runs 24/7, laptop doesn't need to
- ✅ Total workspace: 40GB RAM instead of just 8GB

**Cost Comparison:**
- Upgrading MacBook Air M2 8GB → 32GB: **~$400**
- Mac Mini M2 Pro 32GB (refurbished): **~$800**
- **Result:** 40GB total RAM for ~$800 vs 32GB for $400 upgrade

### Use Case 3: The Platform Developer

**Scenario:** Alex needs to test code on multiple operating systems.

**Setup:**
- **MacBook Pro** (Peer)
  - `macos-native` - macOS-specific development

- **Ubuntu Desktop** (Peer - via Tailscale)
  - `linux-build` - Linux builds and testing
  - `docker-containers` - Container development

- **AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)** (Peer - via Tailscale)
  - `cloud-deploy` - Deployment testing
  - `integration-tests` - Integration test suite

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One dashboard for all platforms
- ✅ Test platform-specific code without rebooting
- ✅ Cloud resources only running when needed
- ✅ Develop locally, deploy remotely in seconds
- ✅ True cross-platform testing

## Team Collaboration

### Use Case 4: The Shared GPU Server

**Scenario:** A startup team shares one powerful GPU machine for ML/AI workloads.

**Setup:**
- **Team Members** (4 developers, each with AI Maestro on laptop)

- **Shared GPU Server** (Peer)
  - `ml-alice-training` - Alice's model training
  - `ml-bob-inference` - Bob's inference testing
  - `ml-carol-preprocessing` - Carol's data preprocessing
  - `ml-dave-experiments` - Dave's experiments

**Workflow:**
1. Each developer has AI Maestro on their laptop
2. All connect to GPU server as peer (same IP, different ports or user isolation)
3. Each can see only their agents (OS-level user separation)
4. Team channel posts when GPU is free

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One expensive GPU server ($3-5k) vs 4 workstations ($12-20k)
- ✅ Each developer manages their own agents
- ✅ No SSH/terminal sharing complexity
- ✅ Clean browser-based interface
- ✅ Can monitor job progress from anywhere

### Use Case 5: The Distributed Agency

**Scenario:** Digital agency with developers in different locations working on shared projects.

**Setup:**
- **Office Mac Mini** (Shared Peer - Tailscale)
  - Powerful build machine for iOS apps
  - Always online

- **Developer Laptops** (Peers)
  - Each dev connects to office Mac Mini
  - Each dev has their own agents on the shared machine

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Junior devs access powerful Mac without buying one
- ✅ Consistent build environment for whole team
- ✅ Centralized resources (licenses, SDKs, certificates)
- ✅ Remote work enabled (Tailscale VPN)
- ✅ Equipment cost: 1 Mac Mini vs 5 MacBooks

## Resource Optimization

### Use Case 6: The 24/7 Background Worker

**Scenario:** Long-running agents that need to stay active overnight.

**Setup:**
- **Laptop** (Peer - close lid and go home)

- **Home Server / NUC** (Peer - runs 24/7)
  - `cron-data-sync` - Syncs data every 6 hours
  - `monitor-alerts` - Watches for error patterns
  - `documentation-builder` - Regenerates docs nightly
  - `dependency-updater` - Weekly dependency checks

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Laptop battery lasts longer (not running agents overnight)
- ✅ Agents never interrupted by laptop sleep/restart
- ✅ Wake up to completed long-running tasks
- ✅ Low-power server costs pennies per day
- ✅ Check progress from phone via Tailscale

**Power Cost:**
- Laptop running 24/7: ~50W = ~$4/month
- Intel NUC running 24/7: ~10W = ~$0.80/month
- **Savings:** ~$40/year + laptop lifespan extension

### Use Case 7: The Bursty Workload

**Scenario:** Occasional need for lots of compute (end-of-sprint, release prep).

**Setup:**
- **Local Machine** (Peer)
  - Day-to-day development

- **Cloud VM** (Peer - spin up/down)
  - `release-build-ios` - iOS release builds
  - `release-build-android` - Android release builds
  - `release-tests` - Full test suite
  - `release-docs` - Documentation generation

**Workflow:**
1. Monday-Thursday: Local development only
2. Friday: Spin up 32-core cloud VM
3. Create release agents on cloud VM
4. Parallel builds complete in minutes
5. Shut down VM after release
6. **Monthly cost:** 4 hours × $1/hour = **$4/month** instead of always-on $730/month

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Pay only for what you use
- ✅ Massive parallelization when needed
- ✅ Local machine stays available
- ✅ Consistent build environment

## Common Patterns

### The Satellite Pattern

One powerful central machine (home/office), multiple lightweight clients (laptop, iPad).

**Use when:**
- Home office with always-on machine
- Need full power anywhere
- Multiple devices (work laptop, personal laptop, tablet)

### The Swarm Pattern

Many equal workers for parallel processing.

**Use when:**
- Testing across multiple platforms
- Parallel builds/tests
- Distributed data processing
- Cost optimization (many cheap VMs > one expensive one)

### The Tiered Pattern

Different machines for different workload types.

**Use when:**
- Workloads have different requirements (CPU vs GPU vs RAM)
- Budget constraints (expensive GPU machine, cheap CPU workers)
- Compliance needs (sensitive data isolated)

## Getting Started

1. **Identify your bottleneck:** RAM? CPU? Platform needs?
2. **Choose your pattern:** Satellite? Swarm? Tiered?
3. **Start small:** Add one peer, learn the workflow
4. **Scale gradually:** Add peers as needs grow
5. **Optimize costs:** Use cloud for bursts, local for steady-state
